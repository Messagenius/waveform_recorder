## 1.7.0

* Expand config beyond just the audio encoder per
  [PR](https://github.com/csells/waveform_recorder/pull/10) from @LucazzP.
  Deprecated the old way of specifying the audio encoder; in the future, create
  a `RecordConfig` and set the `encoder` property of that. Thanks, LucazzP!

* Removing some unused/unneeded packages, again as a
  [PR](https://github.com/csells/waveform_recorder/pull/9) from @LucazzP.
  Thanks, again!

## 1.6.3

* another screenshot tweak

## 1.6.2

* README screenshot tweak

## 1.6.1

* fix [#8](https://github.com/csells/waveform_recorder/issues/8): Display
  waveform if not recording; exposed `amplitudeStream` from the
  `WaveformRecorderController` as a broadcast stream to enable listeners to
  gather the amplitudes for their own purpose, e.g. to show their own waveform

* added a `WaveformController.clear()` method to reset the controller back to
  the original state

* updated the example app to show the waveform after it's been recorded
  (although it's pretty ugly as it is; PRs appreciated!)

* updated the example app to allow for deleted the recorded file

* updated the example app to allow for downloading the recorded file

## 1.6.0

* fix [#5](https://github.com/csells/waveform_recorder/issues/5): Add ability to
  pause recording. Thanks to @Shashwat-111 for [the
  PR](https://github.com/csells/waveform_recorder/pull/6)!
